Key Considerations Before Starting
Legal & Compliance
Data Licensing: Ensure proper licensing for market data (consider costs)

Terms of Service: Clearly state data accuracy disclaimers

Financial Regulations: Avoid giving financial advice without proper licensing

News Copyright: Respect news source copyrights

Technical Considerations
API Rate Limits: Plan for throttling and multiple data sources

Data Storage: Historical data can grow rapidly (plan storage strategy)

Real-time Updates: Consider WebSocket implementations for live data

Scalability: Design for handling market hours traffic spikes

ML-Specific Considerations (Phase 2)
Data Quality: Garbage in = garbage out

Model Validation: Rigorous backtesting required

Explainability: Users will want to understand predictions

Continuous Training: Models need regular updates

Monetization Options (Future)
Premium features (advanced analytics)

API access for developers

Advertising

Affiliate partnerships

Next Steps
Week 1-2: Set up development environment

Week 3-4: Choose and configure data sources

Week 5-6: Build basic data ingestion pipeline

Week 7-8: Create minimum viable frontend

Week 9-10: Implement user authentication

Week 11-12: Add core features and deploy beta

Remember: Start small with a minimum viable product, then iterate. Focus on getting accurate data first, then build features, and finally add ML capabilities.
